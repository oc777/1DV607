## Fixes

__Comments:__

- YachtClub should not be a concept. The whole system you model is a yacht club.  
- There must be some connection entity Booking/Reservation between a boat and a berth, since it should be possible to look back at previous assignments.  
- There can also be boats and berths in the system that currently has no assignment.  
- A Calendar shall have 0 to many events. This is best shown by having one Calendar and one Event concepts.
